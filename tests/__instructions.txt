The following files were used to test the Beefy Simulation solution.

Each file needs to be moved up a directory level and renamed to commands.txt to be tested by the simulator by running 'ruby simulator.rb'.

1. test1.txt
(Test provided by challenge instructions)
PLACE 0,0,NORTH
MOVE
REPORT

Expected output: 0,1,NORTH (PASSED)
--------------------------------
2. test2.txt
(Test provided by challenge instructions)
PLACE 0,0,NORTH
LEFT
REPORT

Expected output: 0,0,WEST (PASSED)
--------------------------------
3. test3.txt
(Test provided by challenge instructions)
PLACE 1,2,EAST
MOVE
MOVE
LEFT
MOVE
REPORT

Expected output: 3,3,NORTH (PASSED)
--------------------------------
4. test4.txt
This test will test for valid PLACE commands

PLACE 1,2,EAST
PLACE 1,two,EAST
PLACE 1, 2, EAST
REPORT

Expected output: 1,2,EAST (PASSED, with the two expected errors mentioned below)

I also expect an error message for the second and third placements with PLACE 1,two,EAST not having valid input type
and PLACE 1, 2, EAST failing due to the x, y and face direction having spaces after the ','
--------------------------------
5. test5.txt
This test will test that Beefy ignores MOVE, LEFT, RIGHT, REPORT commands until a valid PLACE command is entered

MOVE
LEFT
RIGHT
REPORT
PLACE 1,2,EAST
MOVE
LEFT
RIGHT
REPORT

Expected output: 2,2,EAST with no error warnings as the initial commands are ignored. (PASSED)
--------------------------------
6. test6.txt
This test will test that Beefy is correctly ignoring moves and placements that would place it off the table

PLACE 1,2,EAST
RIGHT
MOVE
MOVE
MOVE
PLACE 4,4,EAST
MOVE
PLACE 5,4,EAST
PLACE -1,0,EAST
REPORT

Expected output: 4,4,EAST. (PASSED, with the expected error mentioned below for the PLACE -1,0,EAST command)

I expect the third and forth MOVE commands to be ignored as that would send Beefy to '1,-1,SOUTH' and '5,4,EAST' respectively which
are off the table

I also expect the third PLACE command to be ignored as it would place Beefy off the table and I expect an
error for PLACE -1,0,EAST as negative numbers aren't allowed
--------------------------------
7. test7.txt
This test repeats test5.text but is used to test how simulator.rb handles line breaks in the commands.txt file
MOVE
LEFT
RIGHT

REPORT
PLACE 1,2,EAST
MOVE

LEFT
RIGHT
REPORT

Expected output: 2,2,EAST. (PASSED, with the expected warnings for the two blank lines)

I expect a warning from simulator.rb for the blank lines as they won't match any of the commands

--------------------------------
8. test8.txt
This test repeats test3.txt but uses some mixed case commands and face directions
PLACE 1,2,EAst
MOVE
movE
PLACE 1,2,EAST
LEFT
Move
REPORT

Expected output: 1,2,NORTH (PASSED, with the expected warnings as mentioned below for movE and Move, PLACE 1,2,EAst was ignored)

I also expect a warning from the second and third MOVE commands. The first PLACE command should be ignored as EAst is not a valid face
direction whilst movE and Move will fail because they aren't in uppercase (Note, movE would normally be ignored by simulator.rb but as it is
not in all caps it throws the "Ignoring the command as it isn't a valid 'PLACE x,y,DIR' , 'MOVE', 'LEFT', 'RIGHT' or 'REPORT' command." warning)

These case failures can be removed by changing 'case split_command.first' in simulator.rb (line 37) to 'case split_command.first.upcase'
--------------------------------
9. test9.txt
This test repeats text3.txt but adds extra reports, to see if Beefy keeps taking input and not stopping after the first REPORT command
PLACE 1,2,EAST
MOVE
MOVE
LEFT
MOVE
REPORT
MOVE
RIGHT
REPORT
MOVE
REPORT

Expected output: 
1. 3,3,NORTH (PASSED)
2. 3,4,EAST (PASSED)
3. 4,4,EAST (PASSED)
